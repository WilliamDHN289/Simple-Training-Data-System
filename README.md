In this project, weâ€™ve designed a Data Augmentation Delivery Platform to support large models focused on foundational subjects. This platform is capable of analyzing and processing data across four disciplines: History, Finance, Physics, and Chemistry. There are two roles available for operations within this platform: Data Loader and Data Accepter. The Data Loader can upload data, which the platform assesses to determine if it qualifies as high-quality data within one of the disciplines, and then decides whether to include it. The Data Loader can also view existing data. Meanwhile, the Data Accepter can retrieve data, review data information, and search for data based on specific requirements.
